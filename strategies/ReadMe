TRADING RULES FOR MACD LINES
	1. When the fast MACD line (black) crosses above the slow Signal line (red), it gives a buy signal. Go long, and place a protective stop below the latest minor low.
When the fast line crosses below the slow line, it gives a sell signal. Go short, and place a protective stop above the latest minor high

Histogram:
• When MACD Lines cross over, MACD-Histogram, which is derived from them, crosses above or below its zero line.
• MACD-Histogram measures the difference between the MACD line and the Signal line. It plots that difference as a histogram—a series of vertical bars. 


S2: Buy when MACD-Histogram stops falling and ticks up. Place a protective stop below the latest minor low.
    Sell short when MACD-Histogram stops rising and ticks down. Place a protective stop above the latest minor high.
